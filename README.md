# Hyrax Oil Website

A modern, SEO-optimized company website for **Hyrax Oil**, built with React, Vite, Framer-motion, Sass, and **Vike SSR**. This project uses server-side rendering (SSR) via a custom Node.js + Express server and is currently staged on **Render.com**. It serves as Hyrax Oil’s digital platform to showcase products, company info, and brand presence globally.

## 4. Folder Structure

For clarity and consistency across our codebase, we follow a modular structure optimized for server-side rendering (SSR) with Vike and React.

To avoid cluttering the README, the full breakdown of the project structure, file responsibilities, and SSR integration details is documented separately:

📁 [See detailed file structure and SSR setup](./React_Vike_SSR_File_Structure.md)

This structure ensures:

- Seamless integration between client and server code.
- Per-page config, routing, and metadata management.
- Scalable organization for components, styles, and server logic.

---

## 5. Getting Started

Prerequisites

- Node.js v16 or newer
- npm

Setup

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/hazimdanishhh/hyrax-oil.git
cd hyrax-oil

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

#Change the VITE_SITE_BASE_URL= in the .env file to match the appropriate base URL (for SEO and Meta) - ensure no "/" trailing slash at the end
```

Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

## 6. Development

This project uses **Vite**, **Vike (vite-plugin-ssr)**, and **React**. Below is a guide to understand the structure, flow, and conventions used.

### 🗂️ Page Structure & Routing

- All routes are defined in `src/pages/` using **Vike’s file-based routing** (like Next.js).
- Each route lives in its own folder with the following files:

```bash
src/pages/route-name/
├── +Page.jsx                   # Main page component
├── +config.js                  # Vike route config (meta.title, route, etc.)
├── +onBeforeRender.server.js   # Fetch data and define pageContext
├── page.scss                   # (Optional) Page-specific styles
├── components/                 # (Optional) Page-specific components
```

- The root route (`/`) is in `src/pages/index/`

### 🌐 Global Layout

- The global app shell (layout, providers, etc.) is defined in: src/renderer/PageShell.jsx
- This wraps every page and includes layout components like navbar and footer.

### 🧠 Metadata & SEO

- Page-level meta (title, description, Open Graph tags) is handled in: +onBeforeRender.server.js
- Do **not** manually edit `<head>` in `+Page.jsx` — it's handled server-side.

### 📦 Environment Variables

Environment variables control base URLs used for metadata, SEO, and deployment behavior. (No trailing slash "/" at the end)

```bash
#.env file
VITE_SITE_BASE_URL=https://hyrax-oil.onrender.com   #example
```

- Used in SSR to generate canonical URLs, Open Graph meta tags, and absolute asset paths in each page’s metadata.
- In development (npm run dev), fallback is always http://localhost:3000.
- For staging and production, you must set the correct base URL in .env:
- Make sure to change this URL based on the environment (e.g. staging vs production domains).

This value is used in server-side logic such as +onBeforeRender.server.js and +onRenderHtml.jsx to build SEO metadata like:

```js
// +onBeforeRender.server.js
const url = process.env.VITE_SITE_BASE_URL || "http://localhost:3000";
```

```js
// +onRenderHtml.jsx
const url = documentProps?.url || "http://localhost:3000";
```

### 🎨 Styling

- Use **SCSS** for all styling. The structure is:

  - `src/styles/` for **global** SCSS files.
  - Each page can have its own `pageName.scss` file scoped to that route.
  - Components can have their own `ComponentName.scss`.

- Global SCSS variables are auto-injected from: src/styles/\_variables.scss
- This is configured via `vite.config.js` under `css.preprocessorOptions.scss.additionalData`.

### ⚙️ State & Logic (Optional Notes)

- Global providers (e.g. `ThemeProvider`, `HydrationFix`, etc.) are added in `PageShell.jsx`.
- Reusable logic (e.g. hooks, functions) lives in: src/functions/

---

## 7. Production Build

To prepare the app for production:

```bash
rm -rf dist       #Cleans up the dist/ folder
npm run build
npm start
```

This will generate:

- dist/client/: static assets (HTML, JS, CSS)
- dist/server/entry.mjs: SSR logic used by server.js

---

## 8. Deployment

We use **[Render.com](https://render.com)** (Node Web Service) for staging deployments of this SSR-enabled Vike + React application.

### ✅ Configuration

```render.yaml
services:
  - type: web
    name: hyrax-oil
    env: node
    buildCommand: npm run build
    startCommand: node server.js
    envVars:
      - key: NODE_ENV
        value: production
      - key: PORT
        value: 3000
```

This file allows Render to auto-detect and set up your service when the repo is connected.

To deploy:

✅ Don’t forget to update .env with the correct VITE_SITE_BASE_URL when deploying to staging or production. (no trailing slash "/" at the end)

1. Push changes to GitHub
2. Connect Render to the repository

   - Go to https://render.com and sign in.
   - Click “New +” → “Web Service”.
   - Under Connect a Repository, select GitHub.
   - Authorize Render if you haven’t already.
   - Choose your repository (e.g., hyrax-oil).
   - Render will auto-detect the render.yaml configuration.

3. Fill in Remaining Details (if render.yaml is missing)
   If you're not using render.yaml, you must fill out manually:

   - Name: hyrax-oil
   - Environment: Node
   - Build Command: npm run build
   - Start Command: node server.js
   - Publish Directory: leave blank (SSR apps serve from server.js)
   - Environment Variables:
     - NODE_ENV=production
     - VITE_SITE_BASE_URL=https://hyrax-oil.onrender.com
     - PORT=3000 (Render automatically sets this too, but it's good practice to define it)

4. Deploy

   - Click “Create Web Service”
   - Render will:
     1. Clone the repo
     2. Run the build
     3. Start the Node server from server.js
   - Once complete, your SSR app will be live on a Render-generated subdomain like https://hyrax-oil.onrender.com

5. Auto Deployments
   Render automatically redeploys whenever you push to the connected GitHub branch (e.g., main or staging).

## 9. Metadata & SEO

This project uses **Vike (vite-plugin-ssr)** to inject dynamic, SEO-friendly metadata during server-side rendering (SSR). Here's how it works:

### 🧠 How Metadata Works

Metadata is injected into the HTML `<head>` during SSR using two key files:

#### `+onBeforeRender.server.js`

Each page can define its own metadata by returning `documentProps` in the `pageContext`.

```js
// Example: src/pages/index/+onBeforeRender.server.js
export function onBeforeRender() {
  return {
    pageContext: {
      documentProps: {
        title: "Hyrax Oil | High-Performance Lubricants",
        description:
          "Global manufacturer of high-quality engine oils, greases, and fluids.",
        // You can also add: ogTitle, ogImage, etc.
      },
    },
  };
}
```

#### `+onRenderHtml.jsx`

This is where the SSR HTML output is generated. It reads pageContext.documentProps and injects the metadata into the <head> of the HTML.

You can also define global metadata, such as favicons, Open Graph defaults, or fonts here.

```js
<head>
  <meta name="description" content={documentProps.description} />
  <meta
    property="og:title"
    content={documentProps.ogTitle || documentProps.title}
  />
  <link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico" />
  ...
</head>
```
