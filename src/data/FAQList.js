    question: "What is a lubricant?",
    answer:
      "Lubricant, also known as lubricating oil or lube, is used to reduce the friction, heat and wear between mechanical components that are in contact with each other. It refers to an extensive range of products that are characterised by a large number of base chemicals and additives. They can be either synthetic or mineral-based. Mineral oils are refined from naturally occurring crude oil, whereas synthetic oils are manufactured.",

    question:
      "What is the difference between fully synthetic, semi synthetic and mineral oil?",
    answer:
      "The difference between fully synthetic, semi-synthetic, and mineral oils lies in their chemical composition and how they are produced. Mineral oil is derived from crude oil and is the least refined of the three types. It contains a mixture of hydrocarbons with impurities and lacks the performance-enhancing additives found in synthetic and semi-synthetic oils. Semi-synthetic oil, also known as synthetic blend, is a mixture of mineral and synthetic oils. It offers some of the benefits of synthetic oil, such as improved performance and protection, but at a lower cost. Fully-synthetic oil, on the other hand, is made entirely from chemical compounds and does not contain any crude oil. It is the most refined and highest quality type of oil, offering superior performance, protection, and longevity compared to mineral and semi-synthetic oils. Overall, the choice between these types of oil depends on factors such as your vehicle’s requirements, driving conditions, and budget. It’s important to consult your vehicle manufacturer’s recommendations and consult with a trusted mechanic to determine which type of oil is best for your specific needs.",

    question: "What is the viscosity of an engine lubricant?",
    answer:
      "The performance of engine oil is optimal within two years of use. After this time, it is recommended to replace the oil. When the oil is subjected to high heat and stress, it can become oxidized, thickened, and lose its ability to lubricate the engine effectively. Additionally, the contaminant-trapping properties of the oil will deteriorate over time, causing it to pick up engine debris less effectively. Regularly changing the oil is essential to maintain its optimal performance and ensure proper engine functioning.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is the ability for an engine oils to cleanse is important?",
    answer:
      "To ensure that engine components remain in top-notch condition, it’s essential to maintain their cleanliness as the accumulation of dirt can interfere with the proper lubrication and protection provided by the oil, eventually causing premature engine damage. Therefore, Hyrax branded engine oils are engineered to cleanse and safeguard engines, leading to improved performance.",

  {
    question:
      "There are so many different range of engine oils to choose from, how do I pick the right one?",
    answer:
      "Vehicle-owner handbooks typically provide a minimum oil specification, but you may opt for a higher specification engine oil for improved performance. Choosing the appropriate engine oil for a vehicle is dependent on several factors, including the type of vehicle, its age, and the driving environment. High-performance vehicles require higher performance oil, while newer technology engines require advanced oils to maintain high performance and fuel efficiency. Additionally, modern driving conditions, such as highway driving and heavy stop-start traffic, necessitate high-quality oils to reduce engine wear and tear. At Hyrax Oil, we offer advanced flagship products such as Hyrax Platineum HS, for newer cars and Hyrax Ultimo Premium Plus LS for the modern low-emission diesel engines. For quick and easy assistance in selecting the right oil for your vehicle, feel free to contact our experts.",

  {
    question: "Can I just top-up my engine oil?",
    answer:
      "Continuously adding oil to your engine without changing it can increase the strain on the older oil that is still present, especially with the rise of lighter, contemporary engines that operate with lesser oil in their sumps compared to the older generation of engines. Hyrax Platineum series have a powerful ability to clean up your engine components and goes on keeping engines clean through to the next oil change.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is it okay if I buy additives and mix them with existing oil?",
    answer:
      "Creating an effective formula for engine oils that function properly requires years of experience in blending additives, and the way these additives are blended with the base oil is critical to the oil’s overall performance. We strongly advise against adding any additional additives if you want to get the most out of your vehicle, as this may result in the manufacturer’s guarantee being invalidated.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is changing oil important?",
    answer:
      "Failing to change your oil at regular intervals can greatly diminish the level of protection it provides against engine wear. During engine operation, the oil acts as a reservoir for various by-products that arise from fuel combustion, such as soot, sludge, water, acidic materials, and partially burnt fuel. Additionally, the stress placed on the oil gradually depletes its performance-determining components. Regularly changing the oil ensures that the correct balance of components remains present in the oil, and prevents waste materials from building up, which can otherwise lead to increased deposit formation, metal component corrosion, and heightened wear.",
  },
  {
    question: "How should I dispose of used oil?",
    answer:
      "It is illegal in many countries to dispose scrapped oil by pouring it down the drain as it can pollute the environment. To properly dispose of used oil, it is recommended to take it to an official oil-disposal or any competent recycling centers, which can often be found at local refuse collection points. Another option is to seek guidance from the recycling officer at your local authority.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is Hyrax Oil involved in manufacturing recycled oil?",
    answer:
      "No.  We do not use recycled oils in our manufacturing process because recycled oils can vary in quality and may contain contaminants that can affect product performance and cause equipment damage.

    question: "Does engine oil expire?",
    answer:
      "The performance of engine oil is optimal within two years of use. After this time, it is recommended to replace the oil. When the oil is subjected to high heat and stress, it can become oxidized, thickened, and lose its ability to lubricate the engine effectively.
